# Tax Harvesting Optimization Algorithm: Instructions and Process

## Overview

The Advanced Tax Harvesting Optimization tool uses a sophisticated multi-objective optimization algorithm designed to find the most efficient combination of security sales to meet specific short-term and long-term capital gain/loss targets while minimizing the number of transactions required.

## Algorithm Architecture

### Core Optimization Strategy
The algorithm employs a **greedy optimization approach with combinatorial enhancement**, which balances computational efficiency with precision. It operates on the principle of finding the minimal set of trades that gets as close as possible to both short-term and long-term targets simultaneously.

## Detailed Process Flow

### Phase 1: Data Preprocessing and Categorization

#### 1.1 Portfolio Data Validation
```javascript
// Filter valid lots (quantity >= 1 share)
let lots = portfolioData.filter(lot => lot.quantity >= 1);
```

#### 1.2 Tax Lot Categorization
The algorithm categorizes all available tax lots into four distinct pools:

1. **Short-Term Gains** (`stGains`): Positions held ≤365 days with unrealized gains
2. **Short-Term Losses** (`stLosses`): Positions held ≤365 days with unrealized losses  
3. **Long-Term Gains** (`ltGains`): Positions held >365 days with unrealized gains
4. **Long-Term Losses** (`ltLosses`): Positions held >365 days with unrealized losses

```javascript
const stGains = lots.filter(l => l.term === 'Short' && l.unrealizedGain > 0);
const stLosses = lots.filter(l => l.term === 'Short' && l.unrealizedGain < 0);
const ltGains = lots.filter(l => l.term === 'Long' && l.unrealizedGain > 0);
const ltLosses = lots.filter(l => l.term === 'Long' && l.unrealizedGain < 0);
```

### Phase 2: Target Calculation

#### 2.1 Need Assessment
```javascript
const neededST = targetST - realizedST;  // Short-term gap to fill
const neededLT = targetLT - realizedLT;  // Long-term gap to fill
```

#### 2.2 Pool Selection Logic
- If `neededST > 0`: Use `stGains` pool (need to realize ST gains)
- If `neededST < 0`: Use `stLosses` pool (need to harvest ST losses)
- If `neededLT > 0`: Use `ltGains` pool (need to realize LT gains)
- If `neededLT < 0`: Use `ltLosses` pool (need to harvest LT losses)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Combinatorial Optimization

#### 3.1 Intelligent Sorting Algorithm
The algorithm uses a **dual-criteria sorting system**:

```javascript
const sortedLots = [...lotsPool].sort((a, b) => {
    const aDiff = Math.abs(target - a.unrealizedGain);
    const bDiff = Math.abs(target - b.unrealizedGain);
    
    // Primary: Proximity to target
    if (Math.abs(aDiff - bDiff) < Math.abs(target) * 0.1) {
        // Secondary: Efficiency (prefer larger lots when proximity is similar)
        return Math.abs(b.unrealizedGain) - Math.abs(a.unrealizedGain);
    }
    return aDiff - bDiff;
});
```

**Sorting Criteria:**
1. **Primary**: Distance from target (closest first)
2. **Secondary**: Lot efficiency (larger absolute gains/losses preferred when proximity is similar)

#### 3.2 Multi-Level Combination Testing

The algorithm tests combinations in order of complexity:

##### Level 1: Single Lot Optimization
```javascript
// Test individual lots for best single-trade solution
for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(sortedLots.length, 5); i++) {
    const lot = sortedLots[i];
    const difference = Math.abs(target - lot.unrealizedGain);
    if (difference < bestDifference) {
        bestCombination = [lot];
        bestDifference = difference;
    }
}
```

##### Level 2: Two-Lot Combinations
```javascript
// Test pairs of lots for improved precision
for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(sortedLots.length, 8); i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < Math.min(sortedLots.length, 12); j++) {
        const combo = [sortedLots[i], sortedLots[j]];
        const total = combo.reduce((sum, lot) => sum + lot.unrealizedGain, 0);
        const difference = Math.abs(target - total);
        
        if (difference < bestDifference) {
            bestCombination = combo;
            bestDifference = difference;
        }
    }
}
```

##### Level 3: Three-Lot Combinations (Precision Enhancement)
```javascript
// Add third lot only if it significantly improves precision
for (let k = j + 1; k < Math.min(sortedLots.length, 10); k++) {
    const combo3 = [...combo, sortedLots[k]];
    const total3 = combo3.reduce((sum, lot) => sum + lot.unrealizedGain, 0);
    const difference3 = Math.abs(target - total3);
    
    // Only accept if improvement is substantial (>30% better)
    if (difference3 < bestDifference && difference3 < difference * 0.7) {
        bestCombination = combo3;
        bestDifference = difference3;
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Optimization Constraints and Limits

#### 4.1 Computational Efficiency Limits
- **Single lots tested**: Up to 5 best candidates
- **Two-lot combinations**: Up to 8×12 = 96 combinations
- **Three-lot combinations**: Up to 8×12×10 = 960 combinations
- **Total maximum evaluations**: ~1,061 combinations per target

#### 4.2 Precision Thresholds
- **Minimum improvement threshold**: 30% better than previous best
- **Negligible target threshold**: Targets < $0.01 are considered met
- **Efficiency preference**: When differences are within 10% of target, prefer larger lots

### Phase 5: Dual-Target Coordination

#### 5.1 Independent Optimization
The algorithm optimizes short-term and long-term targets **independently** to avoid conflicts:

```javascript
let recommendations = [];

// Optimize short-term target
if (neededST > 0) recommendations.push(...findBestCombination(neededST, stGains));
else if (neededST < 0) recommendations.push(...findBestCombination(neededST, stLosses));

// Optimize long-term target  
if (neededLT > 0) recommendations.push(...findBestCombination(neededLT, ltGains));
else if (neededLT < 0) recommendations.push(...findBestCombination(neededLT, ltLosses));
```

#### 5.2 No Cross-Contamination
- Short-term pools never affect long-term optimization
- Long-term pools never affect short-term optimization
- This ensures clean tax treatment and prevents unintended consequences

## Algorithm Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n³) where n is the number of lots in the largest pool
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing lot combinations
- **Practical Performance**: Sub-second execution for portfolios up to 1000+ positions

### Optimization Quality Metrics

#### Precision Measurement
```javascript
const stDifference = finalST - targetST;
const ltDifference = finalLT - targetLT;

// Quality indicators:
// "Perfect match!" when |difference| < $0.01
// "Off by $X" when difference is measurable
```

#### Success Criteria
1. **Exact Match**: Difference < $0.01 from target
2. **High Precision**: Difference < $100 from target  
3. **Acceptable**: Difference < $500 from target
4. **Suboptimal**: Difference > $500 from target

### Edge Case Handling

#### 5.1 Insufficient Inventory
```javascript
if (Math.abs(target) < 0.01 || lotsPool.length === 0) return [];
```
- Returns empty recommendations when target is negligible or no suitable lots exist

#### 5.2 No Suitable Combinations
- Algorithm exhausts all combinations within computational limits
- Returns best available combination even if not ideal
- Provides clear feedback on precision achieved

#### 5.3 Large Target Values
- Algorithm scales efficiently with target size
- Prefers combinations of larger lots for efficiency
- Maintains precision focus regardless of target magnitude

## Advanced Features

### Wash Sale Awareness
```javascript
let hasLosses = false;
recommendations.forEach(lot => {
    if (lot.unrealizedGain < 0) hasLosses = true;
});
// Triggers wash sale warning display
```

### Transaction Minimization
