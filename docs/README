- Check that your column headers exactly match the required names
- Remove any extra spaces or special characters from column headers
- Ensure you have all required columns present

**"No valid portfolio data found" Error:**

- Ensure quantity values are numbers, not text
- Check that you have actual position data, not just headers

**Incorrect Holding Period Classification:**
