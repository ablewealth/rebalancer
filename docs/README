2. **Clean Your Data:** Remove any header text, footnotes, or summary rows that aren't actual position data
3. **Check Date Formats:** Ensure all dates are in MM/DD/YYYY format
4. **Verify Numbers:** Make sure all monetary values are properly formatted (the tool handles various currency formats)
5. **Test with Small Files:** Start with a small sample to ensure your format works before uploading large files

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"CSV is missing required columns" Error:**
- Check that your column headers exactly match the required names
- Remove any extra spaces or special characters from column headers
- Ensure you have all required columns present

**"No valid portfolio data found" Error:**
- Remove any "Total" or summary rows from your CSV
- Ensure quantity values are numbers, not text
- Check that you have actual position data, not just headers

**Incorrect Holding Period Classification:**
- If "Holding Period" column is missing, the tool will calculate based on acquisition date
- Ensure acquisition dates are properly formatted
- Manually verify that positions acquired >365 days ago are classified as "Long Term"
