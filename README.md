## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 12+ (optional - works with mock data)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:3000` with mock data.

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

### Full Database Setup (Optional)
```bash
# Create database
createdb tax_harvesting

# Run schema
psql tax_harvesting < backend/database/schema.sql

# Configure environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
```

## 📊 Usage

### Tax Harvesting
1. **Upload Portfolio**: Import your cost basis CSV file
2. **Choose Mode**:
   - **Tax Target Mode**: Set specific gain/loss targets
   - **Cash Raising Mode**: Specify cash needed and current cash available
3. **Generate Recommendations**: Get optimized sell orders
4. **Export Results**: Download CSV for execution

### Model Portfolios
1. **Create Models**: Define target allocations for different strategies
2. **Manage Holdings**: Add/edit/remove positions with target weights
3. **Generate Buy Orders**: Convert cash to portfolio positions

### Buy Orders
1. **Select Model**: Choose from saved model portfolios
2. **Set Cash Amount**: Specify available cash and reserves
3. **Generate Orders**: Get whole-share buy recommendations

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Tax Calculations
- `POST /api/calculate` - Run tax harvesting calculations
- `GET /api/calculate/history/:portfolioId` - Get calculation history

### Portfolio Management
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/portfolios` - Portfolio CRUD operations
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/models` - Model portfolio management

### Price Management
- `GET/POST/PUT /api/prices` - Price data management
- `GET /api/prices/symbols/all` - Get all unique symbols

## 🧪 Tax Harvesting Algorithm

The core algorithm uses sophisticated optimization techniques:

### Tax Target Mode
- **Precision Targeting**: Achieves targets within 1-5% accuracy
- **Overshoot Prevention**: Strict limits to avoid exceeding targets
- **Term Classification**: Proper handling of short-term vs long-term positions
- **Partial Lot Support**: Sells partial shares when needed for precision

### Cash Raising Mode
- **Tax Efficiency Priority**: Sells losses first (tax deductible)
- **Long-term Preference**: Prefers long-term gains (lower tax rate)
- **Optimal Selection**: Minimizes tax impact while raising needed cash
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Shows tax consequences of all trades

## 🎨 Frontend Features
