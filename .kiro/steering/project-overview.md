# Tax Harvesting System - Project Overview

## Project Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅

### What We Built
A sophisticated tax harvesting and portfolio optimization system with dual modes:

1. **Tax Target Mode** - Traditional tax loss harvesting with specific ST/LT targets
2. **Cash Raising Mode** - NEW advanced feature for tax-optimized cash generation

### Current Architecture

#### Frontend (Working Production System)
- **Location**: `src/` directory
- **Live URL**: https://ablewealth.github.io/rebalancer/src/index.html
- **Technology**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Status**: Fully functional with all features implemented

#### Backend (Full-Stack Alternative)
- **Location**: `backend/` and `frontend/` directories  
- **Technology**: Node.js/Express + React/TypeScript
- **Status**: Complete implementation, ready for deployment
- **Purpose**: Modern full-stack alternative to HTML version

### Key Features Implemented

#### Core Tax Harvesting
- ✅ Advanced optimization algorithm with constraint satisfaction
- ✅ Wash sale detection and alternative ETF recommendations
- ✅ Comprehensive CSV import/export functionality
- ✅ Real-time portfolio analysis and position selection
- ✅ Professional results display with detailed breakdowns

#### Cash Raising Mode (NEW)
- ✅ Sophisticated algorithm with tax impact thresholds
- ✅ Multiple optimization strategies (minimize tax/balanced/maximize cash)
- ✅ Precision cash targeting (within 1% overage limit)
- ✅ Advanced constraint satisfaction with automatic relaxation
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and error handling

#### AI Trade Rationale
- ✅ Mode-aware analysis (adapts to Tax Target vs Cash Raising)
- ✅ Intelligent scoring and recommendations
- ✅ Wash sale risk assessment with severity levels
- ✅ Professional formatting with actionable insights

#### Supporting Features
- ✅ Model portfolio management and scanning
- ✅ Centralized price management with CSV import/export
- ✅ Buy order generation with cash allocation
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting and export functionality
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

### Technical Achievements

#### Debugging & Validation System
- ✅ Comprehensive logging framework with categories
- ✅ Real-time data validation and consistency checks
- ✅ System health checks and error detection
- ✅ Calculation verification and suspicious value detection
- ✅ Complete audit trail of algorithm decisions

#### Algorithm Sophistication
- ✅ Multi-constraint optimization with threshold compliance
- ✅ Position categorization and strategy-based sorting
- ✅ Intelligent constraint relaxation when needed
- ✅ Tax efficiency scoring and optimization
- ✅ Precision cash targeting with minimal overage

### Current State
- **Production System**: Fully functional at GitHub Pages URL
- **All Major Features**: Implemented and tested
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and README
- **Code Quality**: Professional-grade with extensive validation
- **User Experience**: Polished UI with clear feedback and guidance

### Next Steps Available
1. **Deploy Full-Stack Version** - Use backend/frontend for modern deployment
2. **Add Real-Time Data** - Integrate with market data APIs
3. **Enhanced Reporting** - Additional export formats and analytics
4. **Multi-Account Support** - Handle multiple brokerage accounts
5. **Advanced Strategies** - Additional optimization algorithms

The system is production-ready and provides sophisticated tax optimization capabilities for both traditional tax harvesting and innovative cash raising scenarios.
