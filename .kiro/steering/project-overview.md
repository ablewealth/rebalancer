# Tax Harvesting System - Project Overview

## Project Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅

### What We Built
A sophisticated tax harvesting and portfolio optimization system with dual modes:

1. **Tax Target Mode** - Traditional tax loss harvesting with specific ST/LT targets
2. **Cash Raising Mode** - NEW advanced feature for tax-optimized cash generation

### Current Architecture

#### Frontend (Working Production System)
- **Location**: `src/` directory
- **Live URL**: https://ablewealth.github.io/rebalancer/src/index.html
- **Technology**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Status**: Fully functional with all features implemented

#### Backend (Full-Stack Alternative)
- **Location**: `backend/` and `frontend/` directories  
- **Technology**: Node.js/Express + React/TypeScript
- **Status**: Complete implementation with Enhanced Tax Harvesting Service v2.0.0
- **Purpose**: Modern full-stack alternative to HTML version
- **Latest**: Advanced target-based optimization algorithms with precision targeting

### Key Features Implemented

#### Core Tax Harvesting
- ✅ Advanced optimization algorithm with constraint satisfaction
- ✅ Wash sale detection and alternative ETF recommendations
- ✅ Comprehensive CSV import/export functionality
- ✅ Real-time portfolio analysis and position selection
- ✅ Professional results display with detailed breakdowns

#### Cash Raising Mode (NEW)
- ✅ Sophisticated algorithm with tax impact thresholds
- ✅ Multiple optimization strategies (minimize tax/balanced/maximize cash)
- ✅ Precision cash targeting (within 1% overage limit)
- ✅ Advanced constraint satisfaction with automatic relaxation
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and error handling

#### AI Trade Rationale
- ✅ Mode-aware analysis (adapts to Tax Target vs Cash Raising)
- ✅ Intelligent scoring and recommendations
- ✅ Wash sale risk assessment with severity levels
- ✅ Professional formatting with actionable insights
