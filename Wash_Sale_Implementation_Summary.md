# Wash Sale Avoidance System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated a comprehensive wash sale avoidance system into the tax harvesting rebalancer based on the framework outlined in "Wash Sale Avoidance Tool.md". The system implements sophisticated ETF similarity scoring, violation detection, and alternative recommendations.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ETF Similarity Database & Scoring System
- **Comprehensive ETF Database**: 25+ major ETFs with detailed metadata including:
  - Index tracked (S&P 500, Russell 1000, CRSP, etc.)
  - Asset class (US Large Cap, International, etc.)
  - Style (Growth, Value, Blend, etc.)
  - Issuer (Vanguard, iShares, State Street)

- **Multi-Factor Similarity Scoring Algorithm**:
  - Index Match (50% weight) - Most critical factor
  - Asset Class Match (20% weight)
  - Style Match (20% weight)
  - Issuer Difference (10% weight reduction)
  - Score range: 0-100

### 2. Risk Tier Classification System
- **Tier 1 (90-100)**: High Risk - Presumed Substantially Identical
- **Tier 2 (65-89)**: Moderate Risk - User Warning Required
- **Tier 3 (30-64)**: Low Risk - Generally Acceptable
- **Tier 4 (0-29)**: No Risk - Not Substantially Identical

### 3. Wash Sale Detection Engine
- **61-Day Window Analysis**: 30 days before + sale date + 30 days after
- **Look-Back Check**: Scans existing portfolio for recent purchases
- **Look-Forward Check**: Analyzes planned purchases against loss sales
- **Partial Position Handling**: Pro-rata calculations for partial sales/purchases

### 4. Advanced Recommendation System
- **Alternative ETF Engine**: Finds suitable replacements that maintain:
  - Same asset class exposure
  - Similar investment style
  - Low wash sale risk (Tier 3-4 only)
- **Smart Ranking**: Prioritizes by expense ratios, liquidity, and index diversity

### 5. Enhanced User Interface
- **Wash Sale Risk Warnings**: Color-coded alerts (red/yellow) with detailed explanations
- **Alternative Recommendations**: Up to 5 suggested replacements per violation
- **Interactive Analysis**: Dedicated "Check Wash Sale Risk" button
- **Compliance Settings**: User controls for detection sensitivity
- **Demo Mode**: Pre-loaded scenarios to demonstrate functionality

### 6. AI-Enhanced Analysis
- **Intelligent Risk Assessment**: AI rationale includes wash sale compliance analysis
